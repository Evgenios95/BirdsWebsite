Vanilla Javascript, html+css+bootstrap

**About this project:**
- This is an introductory project, where in the last version I applied asynchronous JavaScript to play with it.
- The concept is clear, just a quiz, where you:
- - Save the sessions in the local storage in order to view them in the statistics later.
- - I made it responsive with keyframes but I didn't put too much effort on it since I already know how it works.
- - Used FlexBox in order to display the quiz images depending on the size of the screen.
